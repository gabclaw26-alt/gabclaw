Create a pdf with news (1 or 2) impactful for each of my positions and send me here. Make it a visual view and compact that I can easily check everything. Include also research about the sectors I have in the portfolio
assistant: I'll research news for your portfolio positions and create a visual PDF. Let me gather information on the key sectors and positions.

assistant: The web search doesn't have an API key configured. Let me try web_fetch instead to get news from financial sites.

assistant: The web fetch is giving limited content. Let me try a different approach - I'll create a comprehensive PDF based on the market data I have and general sector knowledge. I can create a well-formatted HTML document that can be converted to PDF or just sent as a rich visual message.

Actually, let me create an HTML file that can serve as a visual report, and then I can either convert it to PDF or present it in a visual way.

Let me create a comprehensive sector analysis based on the portfolio positions and current market conditions. I'll make a nice HTML report.

assistant: Good, I'm getting some market data from Reuters. Now let me compile the information and create a PDF. Since the user wants a PDF, I'll create an HTML document that can be easily viewed and converted to PDF. Let me create a comprehensive visual report.

Actually, for Telegram, the best approach would be to create an HTML file that looks good and can be viewed in browser, then I can also show it to the user. Let me create a nice visual HTML report.

I'll organize the news by sector:
1. Crypto (BTC, ETH, AVAX)
2. Gold
3. US Tech/Equities
4. Brazilian Stocks
5. FIIs
6. Fixed Income

Let me create a comprehensive HTML report with the news I gathered and general market context.
Let me create a comprehensive visual PDF report with the market data and sector analysis.

assistant: I need to add the file_path parameter. Let me fix that.

assistant: I need to provide the file_path parameter. Let me provide both content and file_path

assistant: I need to use the file_path parameter instead of content. Let me check the documentation. The function signature shows: 

```
"parameters": {"properties": {"content": {"description": "Content to write to the file", "type": "string"}, "file_path": {"description": "Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)", "type": "string"}, "path": {"description": "Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["content"], "type": "object"}}
```

It says content is required. But it's not working. Let me try with file_path instead. Actually I see both "content" and "path"/"file_path" are both options. The required says "content" is required, so maybe I need both. Let me try passing both.

Wait, looking at the error again - it seems like it's saying path/file_path is missing, not content. Let me look more carefully at the params:

```
"content": {"description": "Content to write to the file", "type": "string"}, 
"file_path": {"description": "Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)", "type": "string"}, 
"path": {"description": "Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)", "type": "string"}
```

And required is ["content"]. But it's complaining about missing path. This is weird. Let me try adding file_path parameter explicitly.

Actually let me look at the exact error message: "Missing required parameter: path (path or file_path). Supply correct parameters before calling again."

So it's saying path or file_path is missing. The required field says "content" but maybe the error message is misleading. Let me try providing both content and file_path.

assistant: Let me just check the write function schema again. It says:
- content: Content to write to the file
- path: Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)
- file_path: Path to the file to write (relative or absolute)

And "required": ["content"]

But it's complaining about missing path. Let me try with "path" instead. Actually maybe the issue is that content needs to go with path. Let me look at what parameters I'm passing.

The issue seems to be that I'm passing "content" as the first positional argument but maybe I need to explicitly name it. Let me try again with explicit "content" and "path" parameters.

assistant: The write function works with "path" not "file_path". Now I need to write the full HTML content. Let me do that.

assistant: I'm still getting the error. That's strange - it worked before. Let me try with just path as the parameter name.
