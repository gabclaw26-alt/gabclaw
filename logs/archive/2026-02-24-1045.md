user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

Create a new skill for substack interaction, I will provide the cookies # How the Python substack_api Library Works (NHagar/substack_api) This note explains the Python library `substack-api` (the NHagar/substack_api repo), based on its GitHub README and repository page. ## What it is substack-api is an unofficial Python client for interacting with Substack content. It is designed mainly for reading and querying newsletters, posts, users, podcasts, and recommendations — not primarily for creating/publishing newsletter posts. The repo README describes features such as retrieving posts, searching posts, fetching metadata/content, and reading user profile/subscription data. It also supports access to paywalled content using your own session cookies. citeturn1view0 ## Installation The README shows installation via: pip install substack-api # or poetry add substack-api This package is published as substack-api, and the repo page shows Python as the implementation language. citeturn1view0 ## Core idea (object-oriented API) The library uses Python classes that map to Substack entities: - Newsletter - Post - User - SubstackAuth (for authenticated access using cookies) The README examples show creating objects and then calling methods to fetch data. citeturn1view0 --- ## 1) Newsletter class A Newsletter object represents a Substack publication URL. ### Typical usage from substack_api import Newsletter newsletter = Newsletter("https://example.substack.com") recent_posts = newsletter.get_posts(limit=5) top_posts = newsletter.get_posts(sorting="top", limit=10) search_results = newsletter.search_posts("machine learning", limit=3) podcasts = newsletter.get_podcasts(limit=5) recommendations = newsletter.get_recommendations() authors = newsletter.get_authors() ### What this means in practice - get_posts(...) returns post objects / post data from a newsletter feed - search_posts(...) queries posts within that newsletter - get_podcasts(...) fetches podcast entries - get_recommendations() reads recommended newsletters - get_authors() gets author information This is a read/query workflow, useful for data collection, analysis, and content indexing. citeturn1view0 --- ## 2) Post class A Post object represents a single Substack post URL. ### Typical usage from substack_api import Post post = Post("https://example.substack.com/p/post-slug") metadata = post.get_metadata() content_html = post.get_content() ### What it returns The README shows methods to fetch: - metadata (title, identifiers, post info, etc.) - HTML content of the post body This is useful if you want to parse, archive, analyze, or transform newsletter content. citeturn1view0 --- ## 3) Authenticated access with SubstackAuth For paywalled content, the library expects you to provide your own Substack session cookies from a logged-in browser session. ### Typical usage from substack_api import Newsletter, Post, SubstackAuth auth = SubstackAuth(cookies_path="path/to/your/cookies.json") newsletter = Newsletter("https://example.substack.com", auth=auth) posts = newsletter.get_posts(limit=5) post = Post("https://example.substack.com/p/paywalled-post", auth=auth) content = post.get_content() if post.is_paywalled(): print("This post requires a subscription") ### Cookie format (from README) The README shows JSON cookie entries including keys such as: - name - value - domain - path - secure and references cookies like substack.sid and substack.lli. The README also states this is intended for users accessing content they authored or subscribed to, using their own session. citeturn1view0 --- ## 4) User class A User object represents a Substack account (by username/handle). ### Typical usage from substack_api import User user = User("username") profile_data = user.get_raw_data() user_id = user.id name = user.name subscriptions = user.get_subscriptions() ### Handle redirect / rename support The README notes that users can change their Substack handle, and older endpoints may return 404.The library includes automatic redirect handling and exposes fields like: - was_redirected - original_username - username It also shows a helper resolve_handle_redirect(...) for manual resolution. citeturn1view0 --- ## How it works conceptually (request flow) At a high level, your code: 1. Instantiates a Python object for a Substack entity (`Newsletter`, Post, `User`) 2. Calls a method on that object (`get_posts`, get_content, etc.) 3. The library performs HTTP requests to Substack endpoints (unofficial/internal-facing APIs) 4. It parses the response and returns Python objects/data The repo README repeatedly frames the package as an unofficial wrapper, which means endpoint behavior can change. citeturn1view0 --- ## What it does *not* clearly provide (for your use case: posting newsletters) If your goal is to post/publish a Substack newsletter programmatically, this repo is not the first choice based on the README: - The documented examples focus on retrieval, search, metadata, and content access - There is no clear README example for creating drafts or publishing posts So this library appears strongest for reading and analysis, not publishing automation. citeturn1view0 --- ## Limitations and risks (from the repo README) The README lists several limits, including: - Unofficial library (not endorsed by Substack) - APIs may change without notice - Rate limiting may apply - Authenticated access requires your own session cookies - You are responsible for complying with Substack terms when using auth features These points matter if you plan to build research pipelines or automation on top of it. citeturn1view0 --- ## Maintenance snapshot (useful when choosing a dependency) From the GitHub repo page: - 170 stars - 29 forks - 9 releases - latest release shown: v1.1.3 (Nov 3, 2025) This suggests the project has user adoption and recent maintenance. citeturn1view0 --- ## Minimal example script (read-only) from substack_api import Newsletter, Post # 1) Read newsletter feed nl = Newsletter("https://example.substack.com") posts = nl.get_posts(limit=3) # 2) Inspect one post first_post_url = "https://example.substack.com/p/some-post" # replace with a real URL post = Post(first_post_url) meta = post.get_metadata() html = post.get_content() print(meta) print(html[:500]) --- ## Bottom line Use NHagar/substack_api if you want to: - collect posts - search newsletter content - inspect users and subscriptions - fetch post HTML / metadata - access paywalled content you are allowed to access (via your own cookies) For publishing to Substack programmatically, you likely need a different project (for example, one that explicitly supports draft creation/publishing in its README).
assistant: I'll create a skill for Substack interaction. Let me initialize it first.

assistant: Done! Created the **substack** skill at `~/vault/skills/substack/` and packaged it to `~/vault/substack.skill`.

The skill includes:
- **fetch_newsletter.py** — grab posts from any Substack URL
- **fetch_post.py** — get content/metadata from a specific post
- **search.py** — search posts within a newsletter

Ready when you are — just send over your Substack cookies (the JSON with `substack.sid` and `substack.lli`) and I'll save them to `~/.substack_cookies.json` so the scripts can authenticate.
